### What I learned
This project was one of those projects that takes time to create. This time I did the design through figma file, which was different from the way I used to approach working with Frontend mentor projects. In general, the work on this project felt more serious from that and more interesting. In general I practiced with style separations in partials and tried to use CSS where possible before going to JS. For example, the options element is based on native radio buttons and theme toggle on checkbox. 


### Continued development
I've noticed many times that I should focus on writing more professional JS a bit more. Often it seems to me that I write code and logic more complicated than it should be. In future projects I would like to try some frameworks for JS, but before that maybe I should try to go a little deeper into the basics again.
